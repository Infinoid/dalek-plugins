=head1 NAME

    modules::local::novemberlog

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of modules::local::githubparser.  It adds a parser to emit
november commits.

Normally november commits are configured automatically by
modules::local::autofeed.  However, that autoconfig sends the messages to
magnet's #parrot, whereas we want november commits to go to freenode's
#november-wiki as well.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 init

This is a pseudo-method called by botnix when the module is first loaded.  It
hands the URL to the github parser module and tells it to emit to freenode's
#perl6.  (If a november parser was already configured, it will consolidate the
config and simply add the freenode channel to the list of targets.)
