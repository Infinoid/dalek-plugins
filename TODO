* Fix rakudolog (For some reason it isn't outputting anything)

* Flesh out the testsuite

* Trac converts "..." to a unicode ellipsis, which crashes parrotlog

* Commonize the googlecode plugin

* Add googlecode atom plugins for:
  * parrot-jvm
  * parrotjs
  * matrixy

* Add a common base class to handle username variations
  * Auto-update the username variations hourly from Parrot's CREDITS file

* Auto-update the feeds list from the Languages page on the wiki
  * Add the necessary metadata to Languages to make this possible, of course.

* Commonize the trac plugin, it'll be useful eventually
